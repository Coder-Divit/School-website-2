      <p class="text-muted">The lifeblood of any institution is its library.
         As the repository of knowledge it serves as the intellectual hub of
         all academic activities. Spicer Adventist University can boast of a 
         large central library with its huge collection of books, encyclopaedia, 
         magazines, newspapers, periodicals, research projects and other holdings. 
         There are spacious reading rooms where students can study peacefully on 
         all working days and nights including Sundays. In addition to this there 
         are separate departmental libraries for the Divisions of Arts and Social 
         Sciences, Business Administration, Commerce, Education, Fine Arts, Religious 
         studies and Sciences.

      <p class="text-muted">Spicer Adventist University recognizes the fact 
        that success in University as well as in later life is founded upon 
        sound health. Through periodic physical examinations the Student Health 
        Centre endeavours to detect and eliminate, wherever possible, those 
        physical disabilities which could hamper students in their academic 
        career. A dispensary is operated under licensed nurses and regular consultants.

        An infirmary is also operating for students needing infirmary care. 
        Qualified doctors are on call as needed. In case of serious illness, 
        provision can be made for hospital care of students at nearby hospitals 
        where complete medical and surgical facilities.
